## [Unreleased]

## [1.8.34] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- **Synchronous COM refresh follow-up stability** (#544): `powerquery update` still used a standalone synchronous refresh path while related Data Model and DAX-backed table refresh operations continued to rely on callback-sensitive COM patterns. Fixed by routing `powerquery update` through the shared COM-safe refresh helper, replacing `EnterLongOperation()` in Data Model refresh with pending-cancellation handling, and wrapping DAX table refresh calls with the same `OleMessageFilter.SetPendingCancellationToken(...)` pattern. Added both Core and MCP regression coverage for `powerquery update`, and the full Power Query feature slice now passes locally.

### Added

- **Power Query stability diagnostics** (#560): Added DIAG traces throughout the shutdown/dispose/PQ refresh paths (gated by `EXCELMCP_DIAGNOSTICS=1` environment variable) to aid future debugging of intermittent MashupContainer.Loader.exe crashes. New `SessionDiagnostics` helper class for conditional diagnostic output.

- **CLI backward-compatibility aliases**: Added `--sheet` and `--range` short aliases in the CLI source generator for backward compatibility with pre-generator parameter names (`--sheet-name` and `--range-address` remain primary).

- **Crash isolation test infrastructure** (#560): Added `ExcelCrashIsolationTests` (4 experiments isolating MashupContainer crash residue and connection property defaults), `PowerQuerySerialWorkflowRegressionTests` (two-pass serial PQ refresh workflow), `ParameterAliasBackwardCompatTests`, and supporting fixtures (`CliPowerQueryWorkflowFixture`, enhanced `CliProcessHelper`).

- **MCP tool cancellation could leave the in-process server wedged until Excel was killed manually**: The MCP `ServiceBridge` created timeout and cancellation tokens but never applied them to the in-process service call, and tool methods did not flow request cancellation into the bridge. When VS Code cancelled a long-running tool call, the Excel COM work could continue on a blocked batch thread while the poisoned session remained in the server, making subsequent requests appear hung. Fixed by running bridge dispatch on a separate task, force-closing the affected session or resetting the service on timeout/cancellation, and propagating request cancellation from MCP tool methods through the shared tool base into the bridge.

- **Remaining synchronous Power Query and connection load paths could still deadlock despite the earlier refresh fix**: `powerquery evaluate`, `powerquery load-to`, `powerquery create` load destinations, and connection worksheet/data refreshes still wrapped `QueryTable.Refresh(false)` or `connection.Refresh()` in `EnterLongOperation()`. That reused the same callback-rejection pattern that previously deadlocked normal Power Query refresh: Excel and MashupHost could not deliver the inbound COM callbacks needed to complete the synchronous load. Fixed by removing `EnterLongOperation()` from those paths too and switching them to the same `OleMessageFilter.SetPendingCancellationToken(...)` pattern used by the repaired Power Query refresh implementation.

- **`powerquery refresh` could hang indefinitely (permanent COM deadlock)**: `EnterLongOperation` was called before `QueryTable.Refresh(false)` and `connection.Refresh()` in the PowerQuery refresh path. `EnterLongOperation` sets `_isInLongOperation=true`, causing `HandleInComingCall` to return `SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER` for ALL inbound COM calls — including essential MashupHost callbacks Excel needs to complete the synchronous refresh. This created a permanent mutual deadlock (observed: 30-minute hang in production on a worksheet-loaded query). Fixed by removing `EnterLongOperation` from both refresh paths and registering a `CancellationToken` with `OleMessageFilter` so `MessagePending` returns `PENDINGMSG_CANCELCALL` when the token fires, enabling clean STA thread exit. **Trade-off**: Elevated CPU (~88%) during refresh is accepted as preferable to a permanent hang. The CPU spin regression tests (`PowerQueryRefreshCpuSpinTests`) are now intentionally expected to fail — they are excluded from CI via `RunType=OnDemand` and updated to document this known trade-off.

- **Structural COM stability improvements**: Addressed root cause of intermittent operation hangs and orphan Excel processes. `ExcelBatch.Execute()` now automatically suppresses `ScreenUpdating` via a new `ExcelWriteGuard`, reducing COM callbacks and improving bulk operation performance. Unified multi-workbook shutdown to use the resilient `ExcelShutdownService` (was bare COM calls without retry). Added retry logic to workbook Save (for file locks) and Close (for COM busy errors). Excel process ID capture now retries 3 times with 500ms delay to prevent force-kill from being permanently disabled under load. Added safety-net `ProcessExit` handler that kills tracked Excel processes on unexpected .NET process termination.

- **Operation hangs with error handling improvements**: Hardened the service dispatch layer so that cleanup failures during error handling no longer propagate secondary exceptions. Dead Excel sessions are now automatically detected and cleaned up in all exception paths. Power Query Evaluate `Refresh()` is now wrapped with `EnterLongOperation` to prevent CPU spin during M code evaluation. Added cancellation checks to COM collection loops for large workbooks.

- **PivotTable test suite no longer hangs**: Fixed a test fixture deadlock caused by using both `IClassFixture` and a collection fixture on the same test class, which created concurrent Excel sessions that deadlocked. Consolidated to a single shared fixture — all 102 PivotTable tests now pass reliably.

- **`range set-formulas` and `range get-formulas` injected `@` implicit intersection operator inside Excel Tables**: The legacy `Range.Formula` COM property automatically prepends `@` to formulas inside structured tables, causing `#FIELD!` errors with custom functions that return entity cards (e.g., Office Add-in rich data types). Switched to `Range.Formula2` (Excel 365+) which respects dynamic array semantics and does not inject `@`.

- **Connection `refresh` and PowerQuery `refresh` / `refresh-all` could hang or miss cancellation on async data sources**: `WorkbookConnection.Refresh()` returns immediately when the provider runs asynchronously, leaving the STA thread without a way to detect completion or honour the operation timeout. Both Connection and PowerQuery refresh now set the sub-connection's `BackgroundQuery = true`, call `Refresh()`, then poll `.Refreshing` in a loop that responds to cancellation and calls `.CancelRefresh()` when the timeout fires. `powerquery refresh-all` was also updated to use the same robust `RefreshConnectionByQueryName` path (which includes `QueryTable.Refresh(false)` for worksheet queries) instead of a bare `connection.Refresh()`.

- **CLI and MCP Server version always reported as 1.0.0** (#523): The update check and About dialog always showed version 1.0.0 instead of the actual installed version. Fixed by removing hardcoded version properties from project files so they inherit from the central version configuration.

- **`table append` JsonElement COM marshalling** (#519): Row values containing booleans or strings were passed as raw `System.Text.Json.JsonElement` to `cell.Value2`, which COM interop cannot marshal to a Variant. Fixed by calling `RangeHelpers.ConvertToCellValue()` (the same fix already present in `range set-values`) to unwrap `JsonElement` to native types before assignment.

- **`--values`/`--rows` inline JSON: PowerShell quote-stripping + stdin sentinel** (#521): Windows `CreateProcess` strips inner double-quotes when PowerShell passes arguments to native executables, so `--values '[["ACD Full Term",0.26]]'` arrives as `[[ACD Full Term,0.26]]` (invalid JSON). The generated `DeserializeNestedCollection<T>` now: (1) emits a clear error message that mentions `--values-file` and `--values -` as workarounds, and (2) supports a stdin sentinel — passing `--values -` (or `--rows -`) reads the JSON from `Console.In`, avoiding shell quoting entirely.

- **Table `add-to-data-model` bracket column names block DAX formulas**: Excel table columns with literal bracket characters in their names (e.g., from OLEDB import sources) cannot be referenced in DAX formulas after being added to the Data Model. Added new `stripBracketColumnNames` parameter (default: `false`). When `false`, bracket column names are reported in `bracketColumnsFound` so users are aware of the issue. When `true`, the source table column headers are renamed (brackets removed) before adding to the Data Model, enabling full DAX access. The `add-to-data-model` result now includes `bracketColumnsFound` and `bracketColumnsRenamed` fields.

- **PowerQuery `load-to data-model` silently succeeded without loading data**: `powerquery load-to` with `data-model` destination returned `success: true` but the table never appeared in the Power Pivot Data Model. The connection was registered via `Connections.Add2()` but `connection.Refresh()` was never called, so data was not actually loaded. Fixed by calling `connection.Refresh()` after creating the connection, consistent with how `load-to worksheet` works.

- **`chartconfig set-data-labels` threw raw COMException on Line charts with bar-only position**: Setting `labelPosition` to `InsideEnd`, `InsideBase`, or `OutsideEnd` on a Line chart threw a raw COM exception with no user-friendly explanation. These positions are only valid for bar, column, and area chart types. Fixed by catching the COMException and throwing an `InvalidOperationException` with a descriptive message explaining which chart types support each position, consistent with how `ShowPercentage` handles unsupported chart types.

- **`rangeformat format-range` parameter documentation listed wrong valid values for `borderStyle`**: The `borderStyle` parameter help incorrectly listed `thin`, `medium`, `thick`, `dashed`, and `dotted` as valid values — those are `borderWeight` values. The valid `borderStyle` values are `continuous`, `dash`, `dot`, `dashdot`, `dashdotdot`, `double`, `slantdashdot`, and `none`. Documentation corrected.

- **`rangeformat format-range` rejected `middle` as a vertical alignment value**: The `verticalAlignment` parameter only accepted `center` but not the common alias `middle`. Both now accepted and produce identical center-vertical alignment.

### Changed

- **`screenshot` CLI `--output` flag documentation clarified**: The `--output <path>` flag saves the screenshot directly to a PNG or JPEG file instead of printing base64 JSON to stdout. This was already functional but was documented as "For CLI: saved to file" without explaining that `--output` is required to save to a file.

- **office.dll not found when opening workbooks with connections/data model** (#487 follow-up): The `AssemblyResolve` handler only searched `AppContext.BaseDirectory` for `office.dll`. In NuGet-installed tool deployments, `office.dll` is never copied there (it is only present in local dev builds via `Directory.Build.targets`). Opening workbooks with external connections, Power Query, or a Data Model triggered code paths that caused the CLR to load `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll`, which in turn requested `office.dll v16`. The handler returned `null` → `FileNotFoundException`. Fixed by adding fallback search order: (1) `AppContext.BaseDirectory`, (2) .NET Framework GAC v16, (3) GAC v15 (accepted by CLR as substitute), (4) Office 365 click-to-run installation directories. `Directory.Build.targets` also updated to prefer v16 GAC when available.

### Changed

- **Migrated Excel COM interop to strongly-typed Microsoft Office PIA**: Replaced dynamic late-binding throughout the codebase with strongly-typed `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel` types for improved reliability and compile-time error detection. Power Query APIs (`Workbook.Queries`) and VBA project access remain as dynamic calls where PIA coverage is unavailable.

### Fixed

- **All Excel sessions crashed with FileNotFoundException for office.dll** (#487): After PIA migration, `ExcelBatch` STA thread declared `tempExcel` as typed `Excel.Application`. Casting a typed COM interop object to `(dynamic)` retains PIA type metadata; the DLR then resolved `MsoAutomationSecurity` from `office.dll` (Microsoft.Office.Core v16.0.0.0) at runtime, which is not bundled with the deployed .NET tool. Every session (create and open) crashed before opening any workbook. Fixed by casting to `(object)` first before `(dynamic)` to force pure IDispatch binding. Also removed a broken `<Reference>` to office.dll with a wrong v15.0.0.0 hint path (runtime required v16.0.0.0).

- **STA Deadlock on Conditional Formatting and Other Re-entrant COM Operations**: `OleMessageFilter.MessagePending` was returning `2` (`PENDINGMSG_WAITNOPROCESS`) instead of `1` (`PENDINGMSG_WAITDEFPROCESS`). When Excel fires a re-entrant callback (e.g. `Calculate`/`SheetChange` event) during a `FormatConditions.Add()` call, `WAITNOPROCESS` blocked COM from delivering the callback — Excel waited for the callback while the STA thread waited for Excel, causing a permanent deadlock. Any operation that triggers Excel's internal event loop (conditional formatting on formula cells, PivotTable refresh, Power Query refresh) was affected. Fixed by returning `1` so COM delivers pending inbound calls during the outgoing `IDispatch.Invoke`.
- **Hung Session After Tool Call Cancellation**: When a user cancelled a tool call while the STA thread was stuck in `IDispatch.Invoke`, `WithSessionAsync` had no `catch (OperationCanceledException)` handler — the session remained alive with a permanently blocked STA thread, causing all subsequent operations to hang. Fixed by adding `catch (OperationCanceledException)` that force-closes the session (same pattern as the existing `TimeoutException` handler).
- **Slow Fail on Successive Calls After Timeout/Cancellation**: After a timeout or cancellation, `Execute<T>` would queue new work on a permanently stuck STA thread, forcing each subsequent caller to wait for its own full timeout before failing. Fixed by adding a fail-fast pre-check: if `_operationTimedOut` is set, throw `TimeoutException` immediately.

- **COM Apartment Boundary in SaveWorkbook** (#482): Removed `Task.Run(() => workbook.Save())` in `ExcelShutdownService` — this marshalled the COM call from the STA thread to an MTA thread-pool thread, which is incorrect and fragile in .NET 8+. Save is now called directly on the STA thread, which is always the case inside `ExcelBatch.Execute()`.
- **Wrong-Process Force-Kill from Fallback PID** (#482): Removed the "newest EXCEL.EXE process" fallback PID detection in `ExcelBatch`. When the `Hwnd` path fails, force-kill is now disabled with a warning rather than risking killing an unrelated Excel workbook the user has open.
- **Redundant `Thread.Sleep` in Dispose** (#482): Removed 100 ms `Thread.Sleep` from `ExcelBatch.Dispose()`. The preceding `_shutdownCts.Cancel()` call immediately wakes the STA thread from `WaitToReadAsync`, making the sleep redundant and adding unnecessary latency.
- **Exception Type Lost in Service Error Responses** (#482): `ExcelMcpService` top-level `catch` blocks now return `"{ExType}: {ex.Message}"` instead of just `ex.Message`, making unexpected failures distinguishable without a full stack trace.
- **COM Timeout Hang** — ExcelBatch now force-kills Excel process on timeout instead of hanging indefinitely on `WaitForSingleObject`; ExcelMcpService catches `TimeoutException` to prevent unhandled exceptions
- **FileSystemWatcher CPU Spin** — Disabled `IConfiguration` reload-on-change in MCP Server to prevent 85%+ CPU usage from `FileSystemWatcher` polling
- **Process Handle Leak** — Fixed `Process` object not being disposed in `ExcelBatch.ForceKillExcelProcess()`
- **Configuration Sources Cleared** — Re-add environment variables and command-line args after clearing config sources (were accidentally removed)
- **Source Generator Type Aggregation** — Fixed nullable type upgrade logic in `ServiceInfoExtractor` that could lose type information across partial interfaces
- **Chart Trendline Parameter Name** — Renamed `type` → `trendlineType` in `IChartConfigCommands` to avoid COM parameter ambiguity
- **Chart Style Error Message** — Improved `SetStyle` error message to show valid range when `styleId` is out of bounds
- **Chart InvalidOperationException** — Added catch for `InvalidOperationException` in chart appearance commands

### Changed

- **Chart Test Performance** — Refactored 80 chart tests to share a single pre-populated fixture file via `File.Copy()` instead of creating individual files via COM, eliminating ~74 redundant Excel sessions

### Added

- **Screenshot quality parameter**: New `quality` parameter on screenshot tool (`High`/`Medium`/`Low`). Default is `Medium` (JPEG at 75% scale, ~4–8x smaller than original PNG). Use `High` (PNG, full scale) when fine text needs careful inspection, `Low` (JPEG at 50% scale) for layout overviews.
- **Window Management Tool** (#470): New `window` tool with 9 operations to control Excel window visibility, position, state, and status bar — enabling "Agent Mode" where users watch AI work in Excel
  - `show` / `hide` — Toggle Excel visibility (syncs with session metadata)
  - `bring-to-front` — Bring Excel to foreground
  - `get-info` — Query window state (visibility, position, size, foreground status)
  - `set-state` — Set normal / minimized / maximized
  - `set-position` — Set window left, top, width, height
  - `arrange` — Preset layouts: left-half, right-half, top-half, bottom-half, center, full-screen
  - `set-status-bar` — Display live operation status text in Excel's status bar
  - `clear-status-bar` — Restore default status bar text
  - MCP Server proactively asks users about showing Excel for visual tasks (charts, dashboards)
  - Agent Mode, Presentation Mode, and Debug Mode workflow guidance
- **CLI `--output` flag** for all commands: Save command output directly to a file. Screenshot commands automatically save decoded PNG images instead of base64 JSON
- **CLI Batch Mode** (#463): New `excelcli batch` command executes multiple CLI commands from a JSON file in a single process launch
  - Session auto-capture from `session.open`/`session.create`, auto-clear on `session.close`
  - NDJSON output for machine-readable results
  - `--stop-on-error` flag to halt on first failure (default: continue all)

### Fixed

- **Screenshot reliability**: Screenshots now work reliably regardless of whether Excel is visible or hidden. Added automatic retry for transient capture failures
- **CLI `--help` crash** (#463): Fixed Spectre.Console markup crash when parameter descriptions contain `[`/`]` characters (e.g., `[A1 notation]`)
- **Source generator tool filtering**: Fixed `mcpTool ?? "unknown"` fallback; added `HasMcpToolAttribute` to correctly filter MCP-only tools
- **Skills docs parameter names**: Fixed wrong CLI parameter names in `conditionalformat.md` and `slicer.md` reference files
- **Auto-save on shutdown**: Sessions are now auto-saved before closing when MCP server exits or client disconnects, preventing silent data loss from session timeouts
- **Session creation resilience**: Added retry logic (Polly) for transient COM failures (`CO_E_SERVER_EXEC_FAILURE`, `RPC_E_CALL_FAILED`) during Excel process startup under resource constraints

## [1.6.5] - 2026-02-03

- **Dead Session Detection** (#414): Auto-detect and cleanup sessions when Excel process dies
  - ROOT CAUSE: `SessionManager` never checked if Excel process was alive, leaving dead sessions in dictionary
  - FIX: `GetSession()`, `GetActiveSessions()`, and `IsSessionAlive()` now check process health and auto-cleanup
  - `ExcelBatch.Execute()` validates Excel is alive before queueing operations
  - Users now get clear error: "Excel process is no longer running" instead of confusing timeouts
  - Dead sessions no longer block reopening the same file
  - Affects both CLI and MCP Server (shared `SessionManager`)

### Fixed

- **Power Query Refresh Error Propagation** (#399): Fixed bug where `refresh` action returned `success: true` even when Power Query had formula errors
  - ROOT CAUSE: `Connection.Refresh()` silently swallows errors for worksheet queries (InModel=false)
  - FIX: Now uses `QueryTable.Refresh(false)` for worksheet queries which properly throws errors
  - Data Model queries (InModel=true) continue using `Connection.Refresh()` which does throw errors
  - Errors now surface clearly: `"[Expression.Error] The name 'Source' wasn't recognized..."`

- **Table Create Auto-Expand from Single Cell**: Fixed issue where `table create --range A1` created single-cell table
  - ROOT CAUSE: Excel's `ListObjects.Add()` doesn't auto-expand from a single cell
  - FIX: Now uses `Range.CurrentRegion` when single cell provided, capturing all contiguous data
  - Prevents Data Model issues where tables only contain header column

### Added

- **Power Query Evaluate** (#400): New `evaluate` action to execute M code directly and return results
  - Execute arbitrary M code without creating a permanent query
  - Returns tabular results (columns, rows) in JSON format
  - Automatically cleans up temporary query and worksheet
  - Errors propagate properly (e.g., invalid M syntax throws with error message)
  - Example: `excelcli powerquery evaluate --file data.xlsx --mcode "let Source = #table({\"Name\",...})"`

- **MCP Power Query mCodeFile Parameter**: Read M code from file instead of inline string
  - New `mCodeFile` parameter on `powerquery` tool for `create`, `update`, `evaluate` actions
  - Avoids JSON escaping issues with complex M code containing special characters
  - File takes precedence if both `mCode` and `mCodeFile` provided

- **MCP VBA vbaCodeFile Parameter**: Read VBA code from file instead of inline string
  - New `vbaCodeFile` parameter on `vba` tool for `create-module`, `update-module` actions
